# Virtual-Mouse
This project implements a Virtual Mouse Control system using Hand Tracking via a webcam. It utilizes Python libraries such as OpenCV, pyautogui, and HandTrackingFunctionalP to track hand movements and gestures, allowing users to control the mouse cursor and perform click actions.

# Features:

# Hand Tracking: Uses a webcam to detect hand gestures in real-time.
# Cursor Control: Moves the mouse cursor based on hand movements, specifically tracking the index finger's position.
# Click Simulation: Detects a specific hand gesture (fingers forming a pinch) to simulate mouse clicks.
# Gesture Detection: Recognizes different hand gestures to trigger various mouse actions (move and click).
# Real-Time Processing: Processes video feed and detects hand movements with low latency.
